      <h2>So. I broke a thing.</h2>
      <p>Do you ever just break something you find important? Hi there. You're a part of the select few idiots like
        myself
        who seem to have things break quite often. Thooouuugh I'm not quite sure what caused my computer to break. For
        some
        context, I used to daily drive a <a
          href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/CSG-EN-XX-ALL-Dell-Precision-Tower-5810-spec-sheet.pdf"
          target="_blank">Dell Precision T5810</a>. It worked pretty great for what I did, however I recently ran into a
        pretty big issue. The motherboard was having power deliver issues, causing the system to crash randomly. While
        it
        wasn't that bad, it really sucked to have a random crashing issue while trying to get stuff done. So. It's time
        to
        make a new machine.
      <h2>Chapter 2: Outbulking a workstation</h2>
      <p>So I need a new base for my machine. However, at the price point it doesn't make much sense to only buy a new
        motherboard, considering I don't even know if that's the main issue. Therefore, I've decided to upgrade to some
        degree. I'm going to stick with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011"
          target="_blank">LGA2011-v3</a> socket so that I can keep on
        using my <a
          href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/81059/intel-xeon-processor-e52697-v3-35m-cache-2-60-ghz.html"
          target="_blank">Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3</a>. However, I want to find a dual-CPU system. While it would be nice
        to buy a supermicro motherboard and do a custom build, buying a prebuilt workstation is going to be more cost
        effective. Therefore, I really only have three different lines of computers to look at. The <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Precision" target="_href">Dell Precision</a> line, the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Z" target="_blank">HP Z</a> series, and
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkStation" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkStation</a>. Of those
        machines,
        there's only a few differnet models that have the correct CPU socket. First off, I'm going to remove the Lenovo
        Thinkstation from the list of possible lines to use. The only possible machine from their line that fits is the
        <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/lb/en/workstations/p-series/ThinkStation-P900/p/33TS3TPP900"
          target="_blank">P900</a>. It does have a dual socket motherboard, however I couldn't find one on ebay for a
        reasonable price. Therefore, I'm automatically crossing it off of my list. I need something that not only fits
        my requirements for what hardware it can support, but something that also will not utterly kill my wallet,
        especially considering I hadn't expected the sudden need to upgrade my machine. So that leaves me with the Dell
        Precision lines and the HP Z line. Let's take a look at the HP Z line next. Of the many different models, there
        are only three that support the LGA2011 v3 socket; the <a
          href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04506309#AbT2" target="_blank">Z440</a>, <a
          href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04496994" target="_blank">Z640</a>, and
        <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04505606" target="_blank">Z840</a>. Right off the bat we can get
        rid of the Z440 and Z640. Both of those motherboards only have a single CPU socket, which breaks my rule of
        "must be a dual socket motherboard". That leaves me with the Z840 model. First, let's take a look at Dell's
        offerings. Then I can narrow it down to two options and choose the best for my needs. As far as dell goes, the
        only two viable solutions are the <a
          href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Precision_Tower_7000_Series_7810_Spec_Sheet.pdf"
          target="_blank">T7810</a> and the <a
          href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell_Precision_Tower_7910_Spec_Sheet.pdf"
          target="_blank">T7910</a>. The main difference between the two is the feature set. The T7810 is basically the
        machine I currently have but with a second CPU socket. While this is nice, I believe that the T7910 will suit my
        needs better. It has more RAM channels, and yes, while it is more expensive, it will leave me with a system more
        suited to my needs and an upgrade path in the future. It will be a more expensive solution, however I believe
        that the extra money will be worth it. So that leaves me with the HP Z840, and the Dell Precision T7910. It
        really wasn't that difficult to decide between the two. When looking on Ebay, most Z840's were around the $500
        range, where as I found a T7910 for under $300. Therefore, I'm buying a Dell Precision T7910.

      <h2>DUST DUST DUST AAAAA</h2>
      <p>Soooo I got the machine. AND BRUHHH this thing is full of dust. In retrospect I should have taken picture of
        just how dusty this stupid thing was. Look at this in in comparison to the old one. <img
          src="new_comp_img/bigSmol.png" alt="big pc >:D"> Sure, it doesn't look that big in the image. But it's massive
        LOL. The thing is huge. To explain how big it is, I'm going to measure it's size in Wii's. Because why not. It's
        2.5x1x2 Wii's. (side note I used the longest edge of the wii to do these measurements) That's like 5 square
        wii's of space taken up by one computer. Anyway. I had to tear this thing down and clean it up. Soooo here's all
        of the parts fully layed out. I did an entire deep clean and had to s c r u b the case to get rid of the dirt.
        Bruh. Here's the cleaned parts. <img src="new_comp_img/electrical_parts.png" alt="electrical parts weeee"> <img
          src="new_comp_img/gpuscrew.png" alt="gpus and screws?"> <img src="new_comp_img/parts.png" alt="casing o.0">
        Wooo!!! This image is missing a few things though. I have an additional 32GB of ram from my old PC that is going
        to be going into this one. I also ordered a second Intel Xeon E5-2697 V3 to put in the machine. I'll have a
        total of 28 physical CPU cores and 96GB of RAM. That should be more than enough for whatever I need to do at
        this current time. Thouuugh I wouldn't mind picking up a compute GPU to put in the machine. Anyway, it took me a
        few hours to get it all put back together, but here is the finished machine. (Yes I know the SSD mounting is
        heracy go yell at someone else.) <img src="new_comp_img/inside_front.png" alt="front_view"> <img
          src="new_comp_img/inside_back.png" alt="back_view"> Yayyy!! It's all put together now :D Now I just gotta do
        software config. Well, obviously I have to do software configurations. How else would I be writing this blog
        post from this very computer that is pictured in the images above LOL
      </p>
      <h2>SIDE RANT: EXPLAIN DELL?!?</h2>
      <p>Ok. So this is just plain dumb. At the end of this little rant there is an image that I have attached comparing
        the surface of two different coolers. The cooler on the bottom is the cooler that comes with the T7910. The
        cooler on the top is the one that comes on the T5810. Both of these are coolers from Dell. Both of these are
        coolers designed to cool chips for the LGA2011-v3 socket. However there's something weird about the cooler on
        the top. There's little divots between the heatpipes. Sure, that doesn't sound very odd, but it's really weird
        that they didn't take the extra two pennies to do more precision machining like they did for the coolers on the
        more expensive machine. They even could have just used the same cooler for both machines, saving them money and
        production costs? I don't know. It most likely makes a neglitable difference in real world performance. I just
        think that it's a really strange oversight. Anyway, RANT OVER. <img src="new_comp_img/siderant.png">
