  <h1>I accidentally did a thing.</h1>
  <hr />
    <h2>So. I broke a thing.</h2>
    <p>Do you ever just break something you find important? Hi there. You're a part of the select
    <br>few idiots like myself who seem to have things break quite often. Thooouuugh I'm not
    <br>quite sure what caused my computer to break. For some context, I used to daily drive a
    <br><a href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/CSG-EN-XX-ALL-Dell-Precision-Tower-5810-spec-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Dell Precision T5810</a>. It worked pretty great for what I did, however I recently ran into
    <br>a pretty big issue. The motherboard was having power deliver issues, causing the system
    <br>to crash randomly. While it wasn't that bad, it really sucked to have a random crashing
    <br>issue while trying to get stuff done. So. It's time to make a new machine.
    <h2>Chapter 2: Outbulking a workstation</h2>
    <p>So I need a new base for my machine. However, at the price point it doesn't make much
    <br>sense to only buy a new motherboard, considering I don't even know if that's the main
    <br>issue. Therefore, I've decided to upgrade to some degree. I'm going to stick with the
    <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011" target="_blank">LGA2011-v3</a> socket so that I can keep on using my <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/81059/intel-xeon-processor-e52697-v3-35m-cache-2-60-ghz.html" target="_blank">Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3</a>. However, I want
    <br>to find a dual-CPU system. While it would be nice to buy a supermicro motherboard and do
    <br>a custom build, buying a prebuilt workstation is going to be more cost effective.
    <br>Therefore, I really only have three different lines of computers to look at. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Precision" target="_href">Dell
    <br>Precision</a> line, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Z" target="_blank">HP Z</a> series, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkStation" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkStation</a>. Of those machines, there's
    <br>only a few differnet models that have the correct CPU socket. First off, I'm going to
    <br>remove the Lenovo Thinkstation from the list of possible lines to use. The only
    <br>possible machine from their line that fits is the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/lb/en/workstations/p-series/ThinkStation-P900/p/33TS3TPP900" target="_blank">P900</a>. It does have a dual socket
    <br>motherboard, however I couldn't find one on ebay for a reasonable price. Therefore,
    <br>I'm automatically crossing it off of my list. I need something that not only fits
    <br>my requirements for what hardware it can support, but something that also will not
    <br>utterly kill my wallet, especially considering I hadn't expected the sudden need to
    <br>upgrade my machine. So that leaves me with the Dell Precision lines and the HP Z line.
    <br>Let's take a look at the HP Z line next. Of the many different models, there are only
    <br>three that support the LGA2011 v3 socket; the <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04506309#AbT2" target="_blank">Z440</a>, <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04496994" target="_blank">Z640</a>, and <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04505606" target="_blank">Z840</a>. Right off the bat
    <br>we can get rid of the Z440 and Z640. Both of those motherboards only have a single
    <br>CPU socket, which breaks my rule of "must be a dual socket motherboard". That leaves me
    <br>with the Z840 model. First, let's take a look at Dell's offerings. Then I can narrow
    <br>it down to two options and choose the best for my needs. As far as dell goes, the only
    <br>two viable solutions are the <a href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Precision_Tower_7000_Series_7810_Spec_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">T7810</a> and the <a href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell_Precision_Tower_7910_Spec_Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">T7910</a>. The main difference between the two
    <br>is the feature set. The T7810 is basically the machine I currently have but with a
    <br>second CPU socket. While this is nice, I believe that the T7910 will suit my needs
    <br>better. It has more RAM channels, and yes, while it is more expensive, it will leave
    <br>me with a system more suited to my needs and an upgrade path in the future. It will
    <br>be a more expensive solution, however I believe that the extra money will be worth
    <br>it. So that leaves me with the HP Z840, and the Dell Precision T7910. It really
    <br>wasn't that difficult to decide between the two. When looking on Ebay, most Z840's
    <br>were around the $500 range, where as I found a T7910 for under $300. Therefore,
    <br>I'm buying a Dell Precision T7910.

    <h2>DUST DUST DUST AAAAA</h2>
    <p>Soooo I got the machine. AND BRUHHH this thing is full of dust. In retrospect I
    <br>I should have taken picture of just how dusty this stupid thing was. It made my
    <br>allergies flare up, it was so bad :( AND this thing is massive :O LIIIKKEEE look at
    <br>this in in comparison to the old one.
    <br>
    <img src="new_comp_img/bigSmol.png" alt="big pc >:D">
    <br>Sure, it doesn't look that big in the image. But it's massive LOL. The thing is
    <br>huge. To explain how big it is, I'm going to measure it's size in Wii's. Because
    <br>why not. It's 2.5x1x2 Wii's. (side note I used the longest edge of the wii to do
    <br>these measurements) That's like 5 square wii's of space taken up by one computer.
    <br>Anyway. I had to tear this thing down and clean it up. Soooo here's all of the parts
    <br>fully layed out. I did an entire deep clean and had to s c r u b the case to get
    <br>rid of the dirt. Bruh. Here's the cleaned parts.

    <br>Wooo!!! This image is missing a few things though. I have an additional 32GB of ram
    <br>from my old PC that is going to be going into this one. I also ordered a second
    <br>Intel Xeon E5-2697 V3 to put in the machine. I'll have a total of 28 physical CPU
    <br>cores and 96GB of RAM. That should be more than enough for whatever I need to do
    <br>at this current time. Thouuugh I wouldn't mind picking up a compute GPU to put in
    <br>the machine. Anyway, it took me a few hours to get it all put back together, but
    <br>here is the finished machine. (Yes I know the SSD mounting is heracy go yell at
    <br>someone else.)

    <img src="new_comp_img/inside_back.png" alt="back_view">
    <br>Yayyy!! It's all put together now :D Now I just gotta do software config. Well,
    <br>obviously I have to do software configurations. How else would I be writing this blog
    <br>post from this very computer that is pictured in the images above LOL
    </p>
    <h2>SIDE RANT: EXPLAIN DELL?!?</h2>
    <p>Ok. So this is just plain dumb. At the end of this little rant there is an image
    <br>that I have attached comparing the surface of two different coolers. The cooler on
    <br>the bottom is the cooler that comes with the T7910. The cooler on the top is the
    <br>one that comes on the T5810. Both of these are coolers from Dell. Both of these are
    <br>coolers designed to cool chips for the LGA2011-v3 socket. However there's something
    <br>weird about the cooler on the top. There's little divots between the heatpipes.
    <br>Sure, that doesn't sound very odd, but it's really weird that they didn't take the
    <br>extra two pennies to do more precision machining like they did for the coolers on
    <br>the more expensive machine. They even could have just used the same cooler for both
    <br>machines, saving them money and production costs? I don't know. It most likely
    <br>makes a neglitable difference in real world performance. I just think that it's a
    <br>really strange oversight. Anyway, RANT OVER.
