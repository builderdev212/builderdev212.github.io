  <h1>My Guide to Microcontrollers</h1>
	<hr />
	<h2 align="left">Scary Stuff</h2>
	<p>Often times I find that the hardest part of a project is finding a good place to start.
	<br>Will my concept work? Will I be able to source the parts? Is there well documented code
	<br>that can be used as a starting point for my work? Microcontrollers are daunting. My goal
	<br>for this guide I hope to give you, whomever you are, a stepping stone into my passion.
	<br>I may not be the best developer, and I'm certain that there are people who could give much
	<br>better advice than I could. However, I hope that my perspective gives you an unique light into
	<br>microcontrollers, and if nothing else makes you think just a little bit more about how the
	<br>world around you works.
	<br></p>
	<h3 align="left">What is a microcontroller?</h3>
	<p>A microcontroller is a tiny computer that is designed to do very specific tasks.
	<br>They could be used to turn the lights on and off over your home network. Or maybe to
	<br>make a macro keyboard for your computer. Or even a game console :D
	<br>
	<br>There are hundreds of different microcontrollers on the market, and as someone new to the field
	<br>it can be daunting to decide what board you should use. However, I'm not going to go over
	<br>my personal opinions on how to microcontrollers in this guide. Maybe in some future post.
	<br></p>
	<h3 align="left">Where do I start?</h3>
	<p>For new hobby developers, I would suggest coming up with a project idea before you purchase a
	<br>microcontroller. Look around at other open source projects. Find some problem you wanna solve.
	<br>Or maybe just come up with some cool gag idea. Over the years I have found that the best way to
	<br>start learning programming, or development in general is to get that initial passion. Sure, you
	<br>may not have a clue where to start, but without passion it doesn't matter. If you want to make
	<br>something work, you will find a way to make it work, even if the solution is jank.
	<br>
	<br>However, there are still good tutorials out there that lead you through the basics.
	<br><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1051" target="_blank">Sololearn's C++ tutorial</a> is what I used to learn C++. They have great guides and the lesson structure
	<br>helped me learn and retain the information. However, microcontroller's dont use C++, they use ino C.
	<br>This makes everyone's lives more difficult, but it does help to grasp at least some C++ before diving
	<br>straight into doing microcontroller programming. If this is your first introduction to programming in
	<br>general, it might be a good idea to start learning the basics with a language like python before you
	<br>learn C++. But you don't have to. You can do whatever you want. :D
	<br>There's no "right way" to learn how do program. As long as you're having fun, and have passion for
	<br>what you're doing, you're gonna want to learn how to do it the right way. If I was in this for money
	<br>I would have switched hobbies years ago.
	<br></p>
	<h3 align="left">What board do I buy?</h3>
	<p>Personally, I would start with an arduino uno. They have good community support, and arduino has amazing
	<br>documentation. I suggest takuing a look at their <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3" target="_blank">setup guide</a>. I personally suggest using Arduino IDE
	<br>2.0 as your development IDE, as it's probably the most user friendly way to start off. When purchasing
	<br>your uno, it wouldn't hurt to buy a kit that comes with wires and other components to start dipping your
	<br>toes into the water.
	<br></p>
	<h3 align="left">What next?</h3>
	<p>This part is for you to decide! I can't force you to do anything, I'm just some random guy on the
	<br>internet trying to maybe give you a stepping stone into a very fascinating hobby. Just remember that no
	<br>matter what you decide you want to do, you can always go to the community for help. The arduino forums
	<br>are full of questions, and there's a good change that whatever issues you're struggling with are things
	<br>that other people just like you have also had to deal with! If you can't find anything about the issues
	<br>you're having anywhere, then make a post in the arduino forums. There's a lot of people waaay smarter
	<br>than I am there, and I'm sure someone can help you with whatever you're struggling to do. :D
