  <h1>I accidentally did a thing.</h1>
  <hr />
    <h2>So. I broke a thing.</h2>
    <p>Do you ever just break something you find important? Hi there. You're a part of the select
    <br>few idiots like myself who seem to have things break quite often. Thooouuugh I'm not
    <br>quite sure what caused my computer to break. For some context, I used to daily drive a
    <br><a href="https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/CSG-EN-XX-ALL-Dell-Precision-Tower-5810-spec-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Dell Precision T5810</a>. It worked pretty great for what I did, however I recently ran into
    <br>a pretty big issue. The motherboard was having power deliver issues, causing the system
    <br>to crash randomly. While it wasn't that bad, it really sucked to have a random crashing
    <br>issue while trying to get crap done. So. It's time to make a new machine.
    <h2>Chapter 2: Outbulking a workstation</h2>
    <p>So I need a new base for my machine. However, at the price point it doesn't make much
    <br>sense to only buy a new motherboard, considering I don't even know if that's the main
    <br>issue. Therefore, I've decided to upgrade to some degree. I'm going to stick with the
    <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011" target="_blank">LGA2011-v3</a> socket so that I can keep on using my <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/81059/intel-xeon-processor-e52697-v3-35m-cache-2-60-ghz.html" target="_blank">Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3</a>. However, I want
    <br>to find a dual-CPU system. While it would be nice to buy a supermicro motherboard and do
    <br>a custom build, buying a prebuilt workstation is going to be more cost effective.
    <br>Therefore, I really only have three different lines of computers to look at. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Precision" target="_href">Dell
    <br>Precision</a> line, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Z" target="_blank">HP Z</a> series, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkStation" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkStation</a>. Of those machines, there's
    <br>only a few differnet models that have the correct CPU socket. First off, I'm going to
    <br>remove the Lenovo Thinkstation from the list of possible lines to use. The only
    <br>possible machine from their line that fits is the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/lb/en/workstations/p-series/ThinkStation-P900/p/33TS3TPP900" target="_blank">P900</a>. It does have a dual socket
    <br>motherboard, however I couldn't find one on ebay for a reasonable price. Therefore,
    <br>I'm automatically crossing it off of my list. I need something that not only fits
    <br>my requirements for what hardware it can support, but something that also will not
    <br>utterly kill my wallet, especially considering I hadn't expected the sudden need to
    <br>upgrade my machine. So that leaves me with the Dell Precision lines and the HP Z line.
    <br>Let's take a look at the HP Z line next. Of the many different models, there are only
    <br>three that support the LGA2011 v3 socket; the <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04506309#AbT2" target="_blank">Z440</a>, <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04496994" target="_blank">Z640</a>, and <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04505606" target="_blank">Z840</a>. Right off the bat
    <br>we can get rid of the Z440 and Z640. Both of those motherboards only have a single
    <br>CPU socket, which is one of the main features I'm looking for.
