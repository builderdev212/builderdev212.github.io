  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>I'm <b>builderdev212</b>, a developer. I mainly program in python and C++.<br /> From tkinter to games, consoles to robotics, to just random code,<br />I dip my toes in many different things... as you can see.<br />Expect to see more in the future as I work on new projects! :D</p>
	<p>Oh yeah, and check me out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAreiM61dpQFQnzbTTRHXg" target="_blank">youtube!</a><br />I upload random content, and the upload schedule is just as random...<br />but I still suggest taking a look. :p</p>
