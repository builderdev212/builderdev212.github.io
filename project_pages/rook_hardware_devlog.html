  <h1>Rook Console Hardware!</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2 align="left">My Vision</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>I've been working on the Rook Console on and off for over two years now. It started as a proof of concept
    <br>laid out on a breadboard and molded into a bunch of individual PCBs jerry-rigged into a jank casing.
    <br>While my current design "works" in a sense, it's a mess and it has lots of issues. Therefore, I've decided
    <br>to develop a mainboard for my console. There are many different pros and cons to this decision. Designing a
    <br>PCB is a challenging task and is something that I have no experience doing. Another con is that it will be
    <br>a lot more expensive compared to buying cheaper boards that I can easily find on amazon. However, I am going
    <br>to design my own mainboard, as the benefits outway the cons. While I have no experience designing PCBs, I
    <br>hope to log my journey as a guide to other developers and hobbyists to help others understand the process.
    <br>It's certainly a valuable skill and one that I hope to learn through this process. While my final product will
    <br>be more expensive than buying random premade boards and frankensteining them together, I will be able to make
    <br>a more compact and reliable console. Soldering a bunch of wires together and trying to shove it all into a
    <br>small casing is very difficult and so far I haven't done the best job of doing it correctly. My goal is to
    <br>create a design that makes replicating my build process similar, for both the casing and the hardware.

    <h2 align="left">What do it need?</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>First off, I need to figure out what all my board needs to have on it. Hmm, maybe some sort of list would be
    <br>helpful here. <i>insert list here</i>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>ESP32 module of some sort</li>
      <li>USB to UART chip</li>
      <li>USB C port</li>
      <li>Power delivery circuit of some sort</li>
      <li>Battery hookup</li>
      <li>Battery protection circuit</li>
      <li>DAC for audio</li>
      <li>SD card reader</li>
      <li>Display hookup</li>
      <li>Power button connector</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Oh yeah</i> thats right. Theres one more thing. I need to make a seperate board for the controls. Well, that one
    <br>would have:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Four buttons</li>
      <li>Joystick</li>
      <li>Some way to connect to the main board</li>
    </ul>
    That's probably all of the main components that I'm going to need. Of course there's going to be a lot of
    <br>work and research that will need to be done before finalizing my component selection though. Annd of course
    <br>there's probably going to be a power/charge indication LED somewhere and a reset button for the esp32. I'll
    <br>go into more detail about the parts as I decide what I'm going to use.

    <p>Weeee. I think I've learned how to make pcbs now. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_p0YV-JlfU" target="_blank">this tutorial video</a>. Massive props to the guy who
    <br>made it, it was very easy to follow and really helped me understand the design process and the software. I didn't
    <br>fully go through his tutorial but I do better understand how to use the software now and will be referring back
    <br>to it for my implimentation of the ESP32 into my board. I'm using EasyEDA and will most likely use JCLPCB to
    <br>manufacture the board. Here are some screenshots of my crappy unfinished dev board following his tutorial lol,
    <br>it taught me how to use the software therefore I believe I'm ready to give my own board a crack.

    <br>yes i know i didn't fully finish it. nu shoot pls :(
