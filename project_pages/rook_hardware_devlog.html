  <h1>Rook Console Hardware!</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2 align="left">My Vision</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>I've been working on the Rook Console on and off for over two years now. It started as a
    <br>proof of concept laid out on a breadboard and molded into a bunch of individual PCBs
    <br>jerry-rigged into a jank casing. While my current design "works" in a sense, it's a mess
    <br>and it has lots of issues. Therefore, I've decided to develop a mainboard for my console.
    <br>There are many different pros and cons to this decision. Designing a PCB is a challenging
    <br>task and is something that I have no experience doing. Another con is that it will be a
    <br>lot more expensive compared to buying cheaper boards that I can easily find on amazon.
    <br>However, I am going to design my own mainboard, as the benefits outway the cons. While I
    <br>have no experience designing PCBs, I hope to log my journey as a guide to other developers
    <br>and hobbyists to help others understand the process. It's certainly a valuable skill and
    <br>one that I hope to learn through this process. While my final product will be more
    <br>expensive than buying random premade boards and frankensteining them together, I will be
    <br>able to make a more compact and reliable console. Soldering a bunch of wires together and
    <br>trying to shove it all into a small casing is very difficult and so far I haven't done
    <br>the best job of doing it correctly. My goal is to create a design that makes replicating
    <br>my build process similar, for both the casing and the hardware.

    <h2 align="left">What do it need?</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>First off, I need to figure out what all my board needs to have on it. Hmm, maybe some
    <br>sort of list would be helpful here. <i>insert list here</i>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>ESP32 module of some sort</li>
      <li>USB to UART chip</li>
      <li>USB C port</li>
      <li>Power delivery circuit of some sort</li>
      <li>Battery hookup</li>
      <li>Battery protection circuit</li>
      <li>DAC for audio</li>
      <li>SD card reader</li>
      <li>Display hookup</li>
      <li>Power button connector</li>
    </ul>
    <i>Oh yeah</i> thats right. Theres one more thing. I need to make a seperate board for the
    <br>controls. Well, that one would have:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Four buttons</li>
      <li>Joystick</li>
      <li>Some way to connect to the main board</li>
    </ul>
    That's probably all of the main components that I'm going to need. Of course there's going
    <br>to be a lot of work and research that will need to be done before finalizing my component
    <br>selection though. Annd of course there's probably going to be a power/charge indication
    <br>LED somewhere and a reset button for the esp32. I'll go into more detail about the parts
    <br>as I decide what I'm going to use.

    <h2 align="left">PCB Development</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>Weeee. I think I've learned how to make pcbs now. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_p0YV-JlfU" target="_blank">this tutorial video</a>. Massive
    <br>props to the guy who made it, it was very easy to follow and really helped me understand
    <br>the design process and the software. I didn't fully go through his tutorial but I do
    <br>better understand how to use the software now and will be referring back to it for my
    <br>implimentation of the ESP32 into my board. I'm using EasyEDA and will most likely use
    <br>JCLPCB to manufacture the board. Here are some screenshots of my crappy unfinished dev
    <br>board following his tutorial lol, it taught me how to use the software therefore I
    <br>believe I'm ready to give my own board a crack.

    <h2 align="left">ESP Module >:(</h2>
    <h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
    <p>There are sooooo many different ESP32 SoCs to choose from when working on a project
    <br>like this. Do I want a lot of flash? I do want a lot of PSRAM? Maybe I only want a
    <br>single core board. Maybe I want a dual core board. Maybe I want a PCB antenna
    <br>attached to the SoC. Maybe I want to use an external antenna. There's so many
    <br>different variations of the ESP32. There's even different cores depending on the
    <br>refresh and make of the board. How on the earth will I ever choose which one to
    <br>use? Well, let's start with looking at the different series of ESP32s.
    <br>They are as follow:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2" target="_blank">ESP32-S2</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3" target="_blank">ESP32-S3</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c2" target="_blank">ESP32-C2</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3" target="_blank">ESP32-C3</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6" target="_blank">ESP32-C6</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2" target="_blank">ESP32-H2</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a></li>
    </ul>
    Yikes, thats a lot of different lines to choose from o.0 Well, lets start with something
    <br>simple. I know that I want to have a dual core SoC, so lets knock out any line that only
    <br>has a single core. The ESP32-S2 series only has a single 240 MHz core, therefore it isn't
    <br>going to be helpful for my purposes. The ESP32-C2 series has a single RISC-V based 120
    <br>MHz core, therefore it isn't going to be an option either. The ESP32-C3 line has a
    <br>slightly faster 160 MHz RISC-V based core, however it has only a single core. The
    <br>ESP32-C6 has only a single core, therefore it also isn't suitable for my needs. The
    <br>ESP32-H2 series has a lower power 96 MHz core, which also isn't going to be helpful.
    <br>That leaves me with the ESP32 and the ESP32-S3 lines. The ESP32 series is the original
    <br>line of the chips. They have both single and dual core configurations, and support 2.4
    <br>GHz Wifi and Bluetooth Classic/Bluetooth LE. The ESP32-S3 is a Xtensa LX7 dual core
    <br>processor that runs at 240 MHz, and has 2.4 GHz Wifi as well as well as Bluetooth 5.
    <br>The newer cores and newer bluetooth revison is a big win in the case of the ESP32-S3
    <br>line. Another benifit of the newer line is the higher flash and PSRAM capacities it has
    <br>to offer. This will be very important when it comes to programming the game engine for
    <br>the console. Since there isn't enough SRAM for a proper framebuffer for the display, I
    <br>use sprites to move things around the display, which is very SRAM and PSRAM intensive,
    <br>therefore the more available the more I can support on screen at a time. With enough RAM
    <br>it might even be possible to make a very simplistic framebuffer. Flash is important as
    <br>it is what I will be storing the game engine and any games on. I've considered having
    <br>a game interpreter that runs images of games through the microcontroller to allow for
    <br>more games to be stored on external storage, however I am undecided as to how I want to
    <br>impliment that as of now. So the more flash and RAM available the better. This leaves me
    <br> with the ESP32-S3 series to work with, which is a much smaller list of possible modules
    <br>to choose from. They are as follow:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf" target="_blank">ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-2_datasheet_en.pdf" target="_blank">ESP32-S3-WROOM-2</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-mini-1_mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf" target="_blank">ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U</a></li>
    </ul>
    Well hey! Thats not too bad at all. There's only a few options left to choose from. The
    <br>ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U is the best documented of the modules. There's several dev
    <br>boards based upon this design that I could use as a basis for my board. It
    <br>supports up to 16MB of flash and up to 8MB of PSRAM. The ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 is
    <br>very similar to the previous module, however it has 3 less GPIO pins, and can
    <br>support up to 32MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM. However, I was unable to find a
    <br>board with a schematic that used this module, meaning that I would only have
    <br>espressif's datasheet to make a board off of. That's not something I really
    <br>want to do, therefore I'm going to cross it off from the list of options. It's
    <br>also incredibly expensive, costing over $18 USD, where as the previous model's
    <br>top spec costs just over $5 USD. The ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U supports up to 8MB of
    <br>flash and 2MB of PSRAM in an external package. It has 3 more GPIO pins than the
    <br>first module. However, it's also getting crossed off of the list, leaving me with
    <br>only the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U module. The difference between the 1 and the 1U
    <br>variant is that the 1 variant has a PCB antenna, while the 1U variant has an
    <br>external antenna connector. For my purposes, I'd like to use a PCB antenna, so
    <br>I'm going to use the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module for my project. But wait! There's
    <br>more! There's different variants of the individual module. Yuck. So many different
    <br>things to take into account. However, this choice is quite easy. The last portion
    <br>to decide is how much flash and PSRAM I want to have on the module. For my use case,
    <br>I want as much as possible, so I'm going to use the <a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/WiFi-Modules_Espressif-Systems-ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8_C2913202.html" target="_blank">ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8</a>
    <br>module with 16MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM.
    <br>
    <br><b>Say ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8 three times fast. You can't >:P</b></p>
