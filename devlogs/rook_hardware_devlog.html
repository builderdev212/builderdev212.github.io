		<h1>Rook Console Hardware!</h1>
		<h2>My Vision</h2>
		<h5>2/19/23</h5>
		<p>I've been working on the Rook Console on and off for over two years now. It started as a
			<br>proof of concept laid out on a breadboard and molded into a bunch of individual PCBs
			<br>jerry-rigged into a jank casing. While my current design "works" in a sense, it's a mess
			<br>and it has lots of issues. Therefore, I've decided to develop a mainboard for my console.
			<br>There are many different pros and cons to this decision. Designing a PCB is a challenging
			<br>task and is something that I have no experience doing. Another con is that it will be a
			<br>lot more expensive compared to buying cheaper boards that I can easily find on amazon.
			<br>However, I am going to design my own mainboard, as the benefits outway the cons. While I
			<br>have no experience designing PCBs, I hope to log my journey as a guide to other developers
			<br>and hobbyists to help others understand the process. It's certainly a valuable skill and
			<br>one that I hope to learn through this process. While my final product will be more
			<br>expensive than buying random premade boards and frankensteining them together, I will be
			<br>able to make a more compact and reliable console. Soldering a bunch of wires together and
			<br>trying to shove it all into a small casing is very difficult and so far I haven't done
			<br>the best job of doing it correctly. My goal is to create a design that makes replicating
			<br>my build process similar, for both the casing and the hardware.
			<br>
			<br><b>Let's get to it! >:D</b>

		<h2 align="left">What do it need?</h2>
		<h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
		<p>First off, I need to figure out what all my board needs to have on it. Hmm, maybe some
			<br>sort of list would be helpful here. <i>insert list here</i>
			<br>
		<ul>
			<li>ESP32 module of some sort</li>
			<li>USB to UART chip</li>
			<li>USB C port</li>
			<li>Power delivery circuit of some sort</li>
			<li>Battery hookup</li>
			<li>Battery protection circuit</li>
			<li>DAC for audio</li>
			<li>SD card reader</li>
			<li>Display hookup</li>
			<li>Power button connector</li>
		</ul>
		<i>Oh yeah</i> thats right. Theres one more thing. I need to make a seperate board for the
		<br>controls. Well, that one would have:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Four buttons</li>
			<li>Joystick</li>
			<li>Some way to connect to the main board</li>
		</ul>
		That's probably all of the main components that I'm going to need. Of course there's going
		<br>to be a lot of work and research that will need to be done before finalizing my component
		<br>selection though. Annd of course there's probably going to be a power/charge indication
		<br>LED somewhere and a reset button for the esp32. I'll go into more detail about the parts
		<br>as I decide what I'm going to use.

		<p>Weeee. I think I've learned how to make pcbs now. I followed <a
				href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_p0YV-JlfU" target="_blank">this tutorial video</a>. Massive
			<br>props to the guy who made it, it was very easy to follow and really helped me understand
			<br>the design process and the software. I didn't fully go through his tutorial but I do
			<br>better understand how to use the software now and will be referring back to it for my
			<br>implimentation of the ESP32 into my board. I'm using EasyEDA and will most likely use
			<br>JCLPCB to manufacture the board. Here are some screenshots of my crappy unfinished dev
			<br>board following his tutorial lol, it taught me how to use the software therefore I
			<br>believe I'm ready to give my own board a crack.

		<h2 align="left">ESP Module >:(</h2>
		<h5 align="left">2/19/23</h5>
		<p>There are sooooo many different ESP32 SoCs to choose from when working on a project
			<br>like this. Do I want a lot of flash? I do want a lot of PSRAM? Maybe I only want a
			<br>single core board. Maybe I want a dual core board. Maybe I want a PCB antenna
			<br>attached to the SoC. Maybe I want to use an external antenna. There's so many
			<br>different variations of the ESP32. There's even different cores depending on the
			<br>refresh and make of the board. How on the earth will I ever choose which one to
			<br>use? Well, let's start with looking at the different series of ESP32s.
			<br>They are as follow:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2" target="_blank">ESP32-S2</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3" target="_blank">ESP32-S3</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c2" target="_blank">ESP32-C2</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c3" target="_blank">ESP32-C3</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6" target="_blank">ESP32-C6</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-h2" target="_blank">ESP32-H2</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a></li>
		</ul>
		Yikes, thats a lot of different lines to choose from o.0 Well, lets start with something
		<br>simple. I know that I want to have a dual core SoC, so lets knock out any line that only
		<br>has a single core. The ESP32-S2 series only has a single 240 MHz core, therefore it isn't
		<br>going to be helpful for my purposes. The ESP32-C2 series has a single RISC-V based 120
		<br>MHz core, therefore it isn't going to be an option either. The ESP32-C3 line has a
		<br>slightly faster 160 MHz RISC-V based core, however it has only a single core. The
		<br>ESP32-C6 has only a single core, therefore it also isn't suitable for my needs. The
		<br>ESP32-H2 series has a lower power 96 MHz core, which also isn't going to be helpful.
		<br>That leaves me with the ESP32 and the ESP32-S3 lines. The ESP32 series is the original
		<br>line of the chips. They have both single and dual core configurations, and support 2.4
		<br>GHz Wifi and Bluetooth Classic/Bluetooth LE. The ESP32-S3 is a Xtensa LX7 dual core
		<br>processor that runs at 240 MHz, and has 2.4 GHz Wifi as
		mes on. I've considered having
		<br>a game interpreter that runs images of games through the microcontroller to allow for
		<br>more games to be stored on external storage, however I am undecided as to how I want to
		<br>impliment that as of now. So the more flash and RAM available the better. This leaves me
		<br> with the ESP32-S3 series to work with, which is a much smaller list of possible modules
		<br>to choose from. They are as follow:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf"
					target="_blank">ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-2_datasheet_en.pdf"
					target="_blank">ESP32-S3-WROOM-2</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-mini-1_mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf"
					target="_blank">ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U</a></li>
		</ul>
		Well hey! Thats not too bad at all. There's only a few options left to choose from. The
		<br>ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U is the best documented of the modules. There's several dev
		<br>boards based upon this design that I could use as a basis for my board. It
		<br>supports up to 16MB of flash and up to 8MB of PSRAM. The ESP32-S3-WROOM-2 is
		<br>very similar to the previous module, however it has 3 less GPIO pins, and can
		<br>support up to 32MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM. However, I was unable to find a
		<br>board with a schematic that used this module, meaning that I would only have
		<br>espressif's datasheet to make a board off of. That's not something I really
		<br>want to do, therefore I'm going to cross it off from the list of options. It's
		<br>also incredibly expensive, costing over $18 USD, where as the previous model's
		<br>top spec costs just over $5 USD. The ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U supports up to 8MB of
		<br>flash and 2MB of PSRAM in an external package. It has 3 more GPIO pins than the
		<br>first module. However, it's also getting crossed off of the list, leaving me with
		<br>only the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1/1U module. The difference between the 1 and the 1U
		<br>variant is that the 1 variant has a PCB antenna, while the 1U variant has an
		<br>external antenna connector. For my purposes, I'd like to use a PCB antenna, so
		<br>I'm going to use the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module for my project. But wait! There's
		<br>more! There's different variants of the individual module. Yuck. So many different
		<br>things to take into account. However, this choice is quite easy. The last portion
		<br>to decide is how much flash and PSRAM I want to have on the module. For my use case,
		<br>I want as much as possible, so I'm going to use the <a

		<br>module with 16MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM.

		<h2 align="left">Existing ESP32 Dev Boards</h2>
		<h5 align="left">2/20/23</h5>
		<p>Alright. I've decided on what ESP32 module I'm going to use. Now I have to design
			<br>the rest of the board around it. Just like the video tutorial that I followed to
			<br>learn how to use EasyEDA, I'm going to be taking a look at some dev boards that
			<br>already exist in order to choose parts and make my schematic. Here's a list of all
			<br>the different schematics I found that use the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1(the flash and PSRAM
			<br>doesn't matter in this case because the pinout will stay the same.):

		<p>It's been a while since I last updated this devlog. I'm going to call this
			<br>"finished" for now. The board does work! Every part of the board works to
			<br>my knowledge. However there are some caviats. I managed to flip my rx and
			<br>tx on my usb port, however with a custom usb cable this isn't a problem for
			<br>my current development. I'm going to split off into a few different devlogs
			<br>for different parts of the project code. I'm going to end this off with
			<br>pictures of what the current board looks like. My first PCB has been made,
			<br>and works.
